### Note

This project was created because we had problems integrating [`ml5`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ml5) with [`@tensorflow/tfjs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow/tfjs).

**([`ml5`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ml5) already has and old version of [`@tensorflow/tfjs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow/tfjs) installed inside as dependency)**
